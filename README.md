# kaze - é¢¨

Tiny and lightweight notification service for Linux.
Implements the [freedesktop notification spec](https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/#hints).
Massive WIP.
Idea: get notification, display a popup, then put an indicator in your bar.
Then you hit a keybinding to view/close notifications.
